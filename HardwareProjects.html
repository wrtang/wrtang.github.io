	<p class = "HWParagraph">In this project, I wired a LCD Display onto a breadboard. I used the Atmega328P microcontroller to supply the LCD with power. I also wrote code that writes to the LCD display whenever the microcontroller is powered.  </p>

	<h2 class = "HWHeaders"> StopWatch </h2><br>
	<p  class = "HWParagraph">In this project, I combined the wiring of the project above and added a button to it. The button is wired to send a input to the microcontroller whenever it is pushed. I also wrote the code of this project to mimic that of a stopwatch. Like a stopwatch, this project has three modes. Start, Stop and Reset. Every time a button is pressed the mode will change between the three. Below is a demo of the project.</p>

	<h2 class = "HWHeaders"> Buzzer </h2>
	<img src = "BuzzerAndLight.jpg" width= 200 height = 200 class = "HWP">
	<p  class = "HWParagraph">In this project, I wired a pierto buzzer and dial onto the atmega328P microcontroller. The code I wrote would poll the dial for an input between 0-255 every second. Once the input is recieved, the buzzer would then play a frequency between 1048 and 2096 hz depending on the input. Below is a demonstration of the buzzer.</p>

	<h2 class = "HWHeaders"> Light sensing LED</h2>
	<img src = "LightSensor.jpg" width= 200 height = 200 class = "HWP">
	<p  class = "HWParagraph">In this project, I wired a photo receptor cell and LED display onto the breadboard. I also wrote code that depending on the input of the light receptor, would change the brightness of the attached LED display. In the code, I polled the photoreceptor every second for an input and divided the 0-255 input returned by the photoreceptor into a specific set of ranges and depending on the input at the time of the polling, changed the brightness of the LED accordingly. Below is a demo of the LED changing brightness.</p>
