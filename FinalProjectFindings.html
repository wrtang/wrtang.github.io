	<h2>User Interviews</h2>

	<p align = "middle" style= " font-size: 25px;">User interviews are important ways to get to know what others (users) would like to see and would expect in a project. The types of questions asked are those that would ask users what they would expect to see on the project. In this case, it would be what they would expect to see, what would they look for in a portfolio website.</p>

	<h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
	

	<p align = "middle" style= " font-size: 25px;">
	A competitor analysis is a close study of what your projects competition might implement. It would serve as a guidline on what works well in the project and what doesn't work so much. I reviewed different types of portfolios to find inspiration about what to build and implement in a website. I also wanted to get some design ideas based on what I liked off other people's portfolios.</p>

	<h2>Feature Value Matrix</h2>

	<p align = "middle" style= " font-size: 25px;">A feature value matrix is a list of features and how they are valued in the Project. It also helps prioritize which features would be good to implement on the project. I selected these features as they were requirements of the project. Additionally I chose features that I thought would be cool to implement on a portfolio website.</p>

	<h2>Feature Prioritiztion</h2>

	<p align = "middle" style= " font-size: 25px;">My features were prioritized based on level of difficulty to implement and what would be more valued to make the portfolio look like what I envisioned in my head. </p>

	<h2>User Stories</h2>

	<p align = "middle" style= " font-size: 25px;">User stories are fictional stories of users that a developer would create in order to get a understanding of the perspective a user may have while looking at a project. I arrived at creating them by trying to look through each of my features and see which user would most likely be interested and view more of that feature. I would then try to develop a story of what the user may look at and what they may deem as a sucess while browsing the website.</p>

	<h2>Cognitive Walkthrough</h2>

	<p align = "middle" style= " font-size: 25px;">A cognitive walkthrough is basically a trial run where a user would use the product and I would observe the actions taken by the user given specific instructions. While conducting the interviews some of the challanges was I didn't always phrase the question correctly. Another problem was that users would often attempt to click on things outside of what I expected.</p>

	<h2>User Test</h2>

	<p align = "middle" style= " font-size: 25px;"> I chose to do a 5 second test and a click test. I chose the click test to see if users were able to identify each tabs easily and be able to access them. I chose the 5 second test to get their impression on the website, and to see what their first reaction would be when given a specific page of the website. The results for the click test was expected. They clicked on the tabs that were given. On the 5 second test though, I felt like I may have asked too many questions that they might have needed to spend more time to investigate before answering. Some of the questions also seemed vague, thus leading to unclear answers.</p>

	<h1>Summary of Findings</h1>

	<p align = "middle" style= " font-size: 25px;">
	While I was conducting my user research I realized that my website looks a bit old and out of the norm while contrasting it to competitors. Through the cognitive walkthrough, I realized that often times users had no idea where to click to view more about my projects. They would often click on the rotating pictures and the links at the top of the page. I also got feedback that the website was a bit old, the coloring was a bit bland and that it felt like my portfolio was too wordy to skim.</p>

	<p align = "middle" style= " font-size: 25px;">
	Some of the challanges I faced while creating this design was the positioning of everything. I found it harder to place everything where I want with the amount of time I was given. Since I didn't have experience with html,css and javascript I also spent most of my time on w3schools and ended up only learning whatever was avalible, thus my trouble with spacing.

	<h1>Incorporation of Findings</h1>
	<p align = "middle" style= " font-size: 25px;">
	Based on user feedback, I plan to minimalize portfolio and keep it simple. I intend to remove the wordy descriptions of Projects and replace it with the slideshow of images from my projects. In the future, I will hopefully put a mini summary of each project into the slideshow and enable users to jump to that specific project page, when clicking on the slideshow image. This would help avoid confusing the user by having multiple areas where they can click. 
	</p>
	
	<p align = "middle" style= " font-size: 25px;">
	Another thing I would like to work on is the design layout of the portfolio as a whole. Right now I have individual pages for everything. If time permits, I would like to implement everything onto one page using dividers and breaks. I feel like this asthetics change would give users more familiarity to the portfolio and lessen the "old" and "bland" types of comments. I also think changing the color of the background to an alternating white and gray after creating continuous scrolling page instead of multiple pages to help distinguish dividers and make the website look easier to use.
	</p>
	
	<p align = "middle" style= " font-size: 25px;">
	Lastly some of the improvements I would love to eventually make on my portfolio would be including clickable links inside each picture to link to a page with more information. I would also like to improve on the asthetics and overall layout of the page, as what I have now is still a bit bland. I will also add other means to contact me on the contact page.
